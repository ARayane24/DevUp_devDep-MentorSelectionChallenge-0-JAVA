** This project made for the MentorSelectionChallenge-0-JAVA challenge, made by Sami Benzetta, discord: samiibenz.
** I thank everyone from the DevUp team for giving us another chance to join the club.
** Here are some notes of the project:

- I made the user choose between the operation based on flags that are in the start of the line.

- All the members and departments are stored on a list in the main file.

- In the ClubDepartment file, on the coManagers array I used a ArrayList instead of List for the ease of use and functionality.

- I tried to take increase that functionality also by using the multiple functions that the Java provide it.

- I also tried my best to give the best comments in the program. ( it was my first time )

Note: If you took a look at the program, you will notice that there is no profileImage variable at the ClubMember attributes, and you will see that it is in comment mode also in almost all the functions that use that variable.
      The reason is that I tried my best to understand the Bitmap and how to use it but still no progress, so I made the program so that the profileImage doesn't exist.

** Hope you liked the program, and thanks again :)
